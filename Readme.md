# Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project repo
## Introduction
This repository contains files used to complete the project for the course "Getting and Cleaning data", part of the Data Science specialization.
The repo contains the following files:
* run_analysis.r
* CodeBook.md
* Readme.md
* TidyDataSet.txt

## Objectives of the project
Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis through running the r script called run_analysis.
  run_analysis.R  does the following:
* 1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* 3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* 4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* 5.	Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## run_analysis.r
run_analysis.r contains r script designed to meet the above mentioned objectives.
Please refer to CodeBook.md for detail explaination of the run_analysis.R

## CodeBook.md
CodeBook.md contains detailed and step by step explaination of the r script, the different variables and functions used as well as all the transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data.

## TidyDataSet.txt
Text file containing the generated tidy dataset.
